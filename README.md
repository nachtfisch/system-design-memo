# system-design-memo

There is already a great repository containing a lot of content on system design.

https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer

However, during my studies I didn't find a lot of foundational content and a way to learn it efficiently. 
This repository contains facts (i.e. cards) on system design fundamentals in a plain text format that can be used to generate Anki decks. I chose plain text as a format since it allows for collaboration and better versioning. There is also the option to generate Anki decks for specific areas.
