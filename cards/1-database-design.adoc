What are the main types of database indices?
---
hash index
lsm tree + ss table
b tree
===

What are pros and cons of hash indices?
---
pro: easy to implement, very fast
con: all keys must fit in memory, bad for range queries
=== 

Index based on LSM trees + SS Table: How do writes work?
---
write first goes to in mem table (balanced bin tree) and once full sorted to file
write ahead log to to increase durability
compaction
===

Index based on LSM trees + SS Table: how do reads works?
---
lookup in mem table, then from newest to oldest ss table (this might be slow, e.g. in case key is not there all tables are looped)
optimization for non existent keys: bloom filters
optimization for faster lookup: sparse table and binary search
===

lsm tree + ss table pros and cons
---
pro: high write throughput (in memory buffer and append only), good for range queries
cons: reads might be slow for old and non existant keys, compaction might take lot of background resources
===

b trees: how does tree structure work
---
ranges and references/pointers to lower segment
a, ref, K, ref, Z
a ref c   d ref k
read and updates are tree traversal
writes might need to create new page depending on page size
durable through WAL
===

b trees: pros and cons
---
pros: relativly fast reads (3 to 4 levels dep), good for range queries
cons: relatively slow writes
===

What's a WAL?
---
write ahead log. Used for durability and crash recovery for database indices based on b-tree and lsm/ss table.
